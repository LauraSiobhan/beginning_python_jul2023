1. In the Python interpreter, create a new list containing the strings
'a', 'b', and 'c', using square brackets, and assign it to a variable.
Run type() on the variable, and confirm that it returns <class 'list'>.
Use the print() function to print out the whole list.


2. Create a new list variable, this time containing three numbers
between 2 and 10.  Using the str() function and the print() function,
print out "X of Hearts" using your three list elements in place of the
X.  Remember that list elements start at zero, not one.


3. Create a new list variable, which contains two of your favorite
foods, and one you don't care about.  Use the print() function to print
out, "My favorite foods are {}", using .format() to replace the {} with
your list.  Now change the food that's not your favorite to one that
is, by reassigning that element in the list.  Run the print statement
again to show that the list has been changed.


4. Add a new favorite food to your list of favorites by using the
.append() method.  Use the -1 index number to print out the food you
just added to the list.  Try using other negative numbers to print out
list elements.


5. In the interpreter, run the sorted() function, with your list of
favorite foods as the argument.  What happens?  Print your list, has it
been changed?  Now run your list with .sort() at the end (like
"my_foods.sort()").  What happens?  Print your list, is it the same as
it was, or has it been changed?
