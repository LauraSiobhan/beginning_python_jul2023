1. In the Python interpreter, use the input() function to answer the
question, "What is your name?"  Assign the output of the function to a
variable, and print out the resulting answer.  Next, get the answer to
the question, "What's your favorite number?"  Using the print()
function and the * operator, print out the number multiplied by 10 (ie,
if I entered 7, I should see 70 as the result).


2. In a new file (exercise_7_2.py), set up a while loop that repeats
until the user enters the string "Python is cool", at which point the
loop exits, and it prints out "Sure is!".  For any other response,
print, "We're not leaving until you say Python is cool!" and repeat the
question.  For this exercise, test the user's response as the condition
for the while loop.


3. Copy exercise_7_2.py to exercise_7_3.py, and update the file so
that, instead of testing the user's response as the while loop's
condition, the user's response is tested inside the loop, and the break
keyword is used to end the loop.  Use True as the while condition in
this version.
