1. In the interpreter, run the bool() function on the following values:

17
'hello'
0
[]
12.1
'' (single-quote characters)

Are the results what you expected?


2. Create a new variable called myvar, and assign the value 2 to it.
Paying close attention to the number of equals signs, run the following
lines of code:

myvar == 2
print(myvar)

myvar == 3
print(myvar)

myvar = 3
print(myvar)


3. In a new file (exercise_5_3.py), create a new variable called name
that contains your first name.  Set up an if statement that checks the
contents of the name variable, to see if it equals (==) your name,
and if it does, prints out 'Hello, {name}!', using an f-string to
interpret {name}.  Try setting the name variable to a different
name, and running the code again.  Try using a single equals sign
in the if condition, what happens?


4. In the interpreter, run the following lines, and note what each one
returns:

5 > 4
4 > 5
10 != 8
5 > 5
5 >= 5
'a' > 'b'
'a' < 'b'


5. In a new file (exercise_5_5.py), create a new variable called age,
and assign a number to it, somewhere between 10 and 30.  First, write
an if condition that checks whether age is equal to or greater than 21.
If it is, have the program print "You're allowed to drink."  Run the
file, and see if it does the right thing (either print something or
not, depending on what number you gave to the age variable).  If it
works, add an "else" condition, which prints out, "You're not allowed to
drink" and run it again.  Does the program behave properly?

Now, modify the program so that it works like this: if age is over 21,
print the "allowed to drink" message. If the age is under 21, but over
18, print, "You're allowed to vote."  If the age is under 18, have it
print "You're a minor."  You will use one each of if, elif, and else
clauses to do this.  Test it with several different ages, and see if it
works like you expect it to.

It may take several tries to get this to work right, and the order of
operations is very important.


6. As an alternative to exercise 5, in a new file (exercise_5_6.py),
implement FizzBang.  The rules are: for numbers that are divisible by
3, print Fizz; for numbers that are divisible by five, print Bang; for
numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5, print FizzBang; for all
other numbers, print the number.  Do this for the numbers 1-30.
