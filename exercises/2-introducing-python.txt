1. Start the Python interpreter, and type the following text:

print('Hello World!')

Close the interpreter by typing:

quit()


2. In the Python interpreter, create three variables that have string
values assigned to them.  Use the print() statement to print out each
of the three variables (this will take 6 total lines of code).


3. Create two variables, one of which contains a string, and one of
which contains an int.  Use the + operator to try print()ing both
variables together.  What error occurs, and what do you think it means?


4. Using the two variables you created for exercise 3, use the
.format() method to print() them out, one next to the other.  The
.format() method is used like this:

'{} {}'.format(one, two)


5. Repeat exercise 4, but using an f-string.  The equivalent code from
exercise 4 would be:

f'{one} {two}'


6. In the interpreter, try running the following mathematical
operations:

5 + 2
5 - 2
6 / 2
12.5 * 2.2

Notice which of these result in an integer, and which result in a float
(floats have a decimal point showing, integers don't).  What about the
multiplication result, anything weird there?
