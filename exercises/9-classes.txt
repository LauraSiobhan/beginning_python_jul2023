1. Create a new file (card.py), which contains a single class, Card.
Give the Card class two attributes: value, and suit, in the __init__()
function.  Create another file (game.py), which imports the card
module.  Add a main() function, and add the "if __name__ == '__main__'"
clause to the bottom, so that it will run the main() function.  In the
main() function, create a new Card object, giving it a value and a
suit.  Print out the card variable, then print out card.value, and
card.suit.  Run the game.py file.  Did it do what you expected?  This
is a complex exercise, we will definitely be discussing it.


2. In the card.py file, add __str__() method to the Card class.  It
should return a string like "2 of hearts".  Run the game.py file again
as it was from exercise 1.  What changed?


3. In the card.py file, add a new method called points() to the Card
class, which will report the number of points this card is worth.  This
method will examine self.value, and return an integer.  Use the same
values as before: number cards are worth their number, face cards are
worth 10, and ace is worth 11.  Refer back to the code you wrote for
section 8.  In game.py, print the value of card.points() to see if it's
working as expected.
