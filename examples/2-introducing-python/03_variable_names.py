# Variable name examples

# Too short
u = 'Laura Johnston'

# Too verbose
current_user_first_last = 'Laura Johnston'

# CamelCase
userName = 'Laura Johnston'

# Leading capital letter - this should only be used for classes
Username = 'Laura Johnston'

# Good variable name
user_name = 'Laura Johnston'

# Bonus question: Why might I choose user_name instead of username here?
