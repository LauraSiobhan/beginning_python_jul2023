# Basic string
my_string = 'hello!'
other_string = "hello!"

# Why to use single vs. double quotes
single_quoted = 'He knew what "scare quotes" were'
double_quoted = "He didn't know why they were scary, though"

# Dealing with double *and* single quotes in one string
escaped_string = 'He didn\'t know what "scare quotes" were'


# Changing case on strings
my_car = 'toyota'

# Concatenating (mushing together) strings:
first_string = 'Hello'
second_string = 'world!'
print(first_string + second_string)

# What's missing from my concatenated string?
